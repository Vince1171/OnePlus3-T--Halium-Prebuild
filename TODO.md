### This list all bugs/issues currently on the port

* rotation randomly stop working (seems related to minimediaservice)
* wifi sometimes take time to start/don't start at all
* no calls
* no camera
* sound support isn't complete (no system sound)
* no Bluetooth
* no recovery (so no reset/update possible for now)
* ~no headphone-jack detected~ sound isn't rerouted to headphones when connected
* no mtp/adb
* no libertine
* no fingerprint scanner
* no apparmor (app still crash even after patch apparmor)
* boot takes 60+ seconds randomly
* not all sensors are working/detected
* media-hub doesn't work


any help with those issues would be appreciated
